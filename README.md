# GitHub User Search

This JavaScript project enables users to search for GitHub profiles using the GitHub API. 
The application provides a user-friendly interface with dynamically generated user cards and repositories. 

## Key Features

- **User Search:** Users can input a GitHub username in the search bar, triggering an asynchronous request to fetch user data from the GitHub API.

- **User Card Display:** Upon a successful user retrieval, the application dynamically generates a user card displaying the user's avatar, name, bio, followers, following, and public repositories.

- **Repository Display:** The project fetches and displays a user's repositories, linking each repository name to its GitHub page. A maximum of three repositories is shown for simplicity.

- **Error Handling:** In case of a non-existent user or an issue fetching repositories, the application provides error messages within a user-friendly card format.

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining readability and aesthetics.
